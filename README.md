# 🚀 Build and Deploy Your Own Blog with GenAI + Web Dev Tools

Welcome to your guide for launching a personal or professional blog using cutting-edge generative AI tools and modern web deployment platforms. This tutorial walks you through how we built [HybridSec.org](https://hybridsec.org) using a no-code/low-code approach and deployed it for free with GitHub and Netlify.

## 🧠 Step-by-Step: From Idea to Blog

### 1. 💡 Generate the Blog with Bolt.new

- Go to [https://bolt.new](https://bolt.new)
- Describe your blog in natural language (e.g., "Create a cybersecurity and science blog with blog posts, tags, a homepage, and markdown support.")
- Let Bolt.new generate your complete blog application (including code, routing, and markdown support)
- Download or export your generated project

### 2. 🧑‍💻 Open and Customize in StackBlitz

- Open [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com)
- Upload your Bolt.new-generated project or drag and drop the ZIP folder
- Edit content, styling, layout, or markdown files as needed
  - Customize `config.ts` or `site.ts` for metadata like blog title and author
  - Add posts to the `/content` or `/posts` folder using Markdown

### 3. 🌐 Version Control with GitHub

- Create a new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/new)
- Connect StackBlitz to GitHub, or push your local code using Git:
  ```bash
  git init
  git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit of blog project"
  git push -u origin main

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text

├── src/
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
