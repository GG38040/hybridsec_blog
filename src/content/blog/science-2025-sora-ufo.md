## Introduction

As generative AI reshapes science and intelligence collection, one unexpected application is now catching attention: using multimodal AI to **reconstruct UFO sightings from witness reports**. With **OpenAI’s Sora** and Wikipedia’s vast consensus-driven documentation, we demonstrate how you can recreate key sightings as visual narratives—offering fresh insight into phenomena once deemed purely anecdotal.

In this tutorial, we’ll show how you can use **Sora to generate UFO images from aggregated witness testimony**, all processed through public knowledge bases like Wikipedia. The goal isn’t to prove or disprove events—but to **build a method for visual, repeatable investigation** of anomalous aerial encounters.

## Step 1: Source Eyewitness Reports

Start with Wikipedia. For our case study, we explored:

- [The 1976 Tehran UFO incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Tehran_UFO_incident)
- [The 2004 USS Nimitz UFO encounter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Nimitz_UFO_incident)
- [Phoenix Lights (1997)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Lights)

Each of these pages contains **composite descriptions**—often the result of **dozens of cross-verified statements** by military personnel, radar operators, and civilians.

### Objective:
Extract key elements described by witnesses:
- Light patterns (triangular, elliptical)
- Behavior (hovering, accelerating, splitting into smaller objects)
- Environmental context (mountain backdrop, city skyline, desert sky)

## Step 2: Prompt Sora with Witness Consensus

Using extracted consensus details, we formatted prompts for Sora like:
