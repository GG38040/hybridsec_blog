# Climate Pressure and the Rise of Authoritarianism

In this new blog series, HybridSec explores one of the most urgent and underexamined dynamics of the 21st century: the correlation between escalating climate disruption and the global resurgence of authoritarianism. This isn't speculative — it's visible in economic stress, political backlash, and centralized power responses to instability.

## The Hypothesis

Could extreme weather, rising disaster costs, and climate anxiety be fueling a turn toward authoritarian politics? The data offers clues.

Over the last 20 years, global temperature anomalies have steadily increased. This trend aligns with intensified droughts, floods, and displacement — each straining national infrastructures and testing democratic resilience.

As environmental and economic pressures build, countries around the world have seen a measurable drift toward authoritarian governance. Power becomes centralized, dissent restricted — often in the name of stability or emergency response.

### Weather Disaster Claims (2003–2022)

From wildfires to hurricanes, disaster-related claims have soared — a financial indicator of climate volatility. These escalating costs reflect not only destruction, but systemic stress that often justifies tighter controls and securitized responses.
