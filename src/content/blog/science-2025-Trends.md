# Quantum Computing in 2025: From Promise to Practicality

Quantum computing has crossed a critical threshold in 2025—from theoretical curiosity to early-stage commercial and scientific utility. Powered by breakthroughs in hardware stability, quantum-classical integration, and growing public-private investment, quantum systems are beginning to tackle complex problems beyond the reach of classical machines.

## Quantum Milestones Reached in 2025

The past year has seen unprecedented progress in scaling, coherence, and real-world deployment:

- **QuantumTech’s 512-qubit superconducting processor**, “Orion,” surpassed 2023’s Aurora platform with 12ms coherence time and 99.5% gate fidelity.
- **IBM’s quantum utility program** demonstrated quantum advantage in catalytic reaction modeling—a first for real chemical synthesis.
- **PsiNet**, a prototype quantum internet node, successfully transferred entangled states between labs on opposite sides of the Atlantic.

## Applied Breakthroughs by Sector

### Drug Discovery and Molecular Design

Quantum systems are now integrated into pre-clinical pharmaceutical pipelines:

- Simulations of protein-ligand binding at quantum resolution cut **early-stage drug screening times by 40%**.
- Pfizer, in collaboration with QubitWorks, announced a quantum-aided antiviral compound entering Phase I trials.

### Logistics and Optimization

Quantum algorithms are enhancing global supply chain and delivery operations:

- DHL deployed a hybrid quantum
